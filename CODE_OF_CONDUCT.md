# Orangopus Etiquette
In order to ensure the safety of our members, we've put together a set of rules you have to follow if you decide to enroll to Orangopus.

**Foster A Positive Environment :thumbsup:**
Treat others as you wish to be treated. If it's not appropriate for your ol' grandma to hear, don't say it here.

**Be Considerate :thumbsup:**
We all come from diverse backgrounds, and many people have different sensitivities. Stop when someone else gets uncomfortable.

**Wheaton's Law :thumbsup:**
You know the rest...

**Conflict & Resolution :crossed_swords:**
Disagreements should be dealt with in private. If it is to be brought into the public eye, we will purge it.

**Spamming & Trolling :japanese_goblin:**
Any members who engage in spamming the text-channels will be kicked. If there is a second occurrence you will be permanently banned from our community globally. The same is in accordance for trolling content. Please use the relative text-channels to use memes.

**Advertising :pencil:**
Use common sense. Do not DM others with unsolicited links. Furthermore, make sure the content you are advertising in Orangopus is safe-for-work. Any other content will be purged and you will receive a warning.

**Racism, sexism, stalking, harassment or any other form of abusive behaviour will NOT be tolerated... NSFW media content is NOT allowed.**
This includes posts/pictures that reference any NSFW content. We accept anyone from any background, gender and sexuality.
